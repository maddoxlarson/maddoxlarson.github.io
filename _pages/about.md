<!-- ## Philosopher, Epistemologist, Logician -->

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student graduating in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy with minors in economics and mathematics and a concentration in undergraduate research and scholarship at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, USA.

Research interests
===

My primary research interests are in **epistemology** and **philosophy of mind**. Broadly, I am interested in how we form our worldviews and belief systems. Thus, in epistemology, I am very interested in epistemic normativity and social epistemology. In philosophy of mind, I consider the role of emotion and affective responses in influencing beliefs and other propositional attitudes. In turn, these come to bear on epistemology as well.

I also have secondary interests in **political philosophy** and **economic philosophy**. Since the beliefs and worldviews often come into conflict with others, it is a worthwhile pursuit to identify not only how those systems are influenced by social conditions, but also how social conditions are influenced by those beliefs. In both political and economic philosophy, this means questioning the psychological (esp. epistemic) impact of social structures.

Previous experience
===

Within the past few years, I have been able to assist or work under several professors in their research. In 2023-24, I assisted Professor Anne Ozar on her sabbatical project "Why Trust? Decline in Trust and Dangers to Democracy". This resulted in the presentation of an essay called "Epistemic Unbelonging: Civic Trust in a Post-Truth Democracy" at the 41st International Social Philosophy Conference.

From May 2022 to December 2022, I was a Gail Werner-Robertson Research Fellow with the [Menard Family Center for Economic Inquiry](https://www.creighton.edu/menard-center-for-economic-inquiry) supervised by Professor Michael D. Thomas. My project was titled "Shared Mental Models in the Context of State-Religion" and explored the epistemic impacts of allowing religious governance to occur via national government mechanisms. This resulted in the publication of "Epistemic Vulnerability and Tolerance in Society" in *The Philosophy, Politics, and Economics Review*.

And, finally, during the spring semesters of 2022 and 2023, I participated in Professor Kevin M. Graham's Slave Narrative Research Group. In 2022, the group co-authored an essay "Black Trust and White Allies: Insights from Slave Narratives" which was presented by Prof. Graham at 39th International Social Philosophy Conference and published in *Social Philosophy Today*. In 2023, the group co-authored an essay "Resistance to Oppresion in Slave Narratives" which was presented at 40st International Social Philosophy Conference.
