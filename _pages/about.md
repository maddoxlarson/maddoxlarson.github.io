I'm currently finishing a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy with minors in economics and mathematics from Creighton University in Omaha, NE. In September, I will begin pursuing my Ph.D. in philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL.

<!-- I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. I hold a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in philosophy with minors in economics and mathematics from Creighton University in Omaha, NE. -->

My primary research interests are in **epistemology** (incl. social, virtue, zetetic) and **philosophy of science** (incl. social science). In epistemology, I focus on belief, rationality, normativity, and responsibility. Specfically, I'm interested in how groups and communities influence our standards for evidence and justification when forming beliefs. In philosophy of science, I'm interested in the structure of inquiry and role of models in scientific investigation. I also have secondary interests in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and social & political philosophy.

<!-- I'm also passionate about getting undergraduate students involved in philosophy. While at Creighton, I served as the Co-Chair of the [Midwest Undergraduate Philosophy Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/midwest-undergrad-philosophy/home "Midwest Undergraduate Philosophy Conference") Organizing Committee and helped host the most competitive conference in its 25 year history. At Northwestern, I am involved with the Minorities and Philosophy chapter. Resources for all undergraduate students interested in pursuing philosophy are available [here](/more/). -->

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy reading literary fiction, watching TV sitcoms, traveling, trying new food, and completing computer programming challenges on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/tinygenius.png).
