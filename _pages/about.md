In September, I will begin pursuing my Ph.D. in philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. Before Northwestern, I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, with minors in economics and mathematics and a concentration in undergraduate research, from Creighton University in Omaha, NE.

<!-- I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. I hold a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in philosophy with minors in economics and mathematics from Creighton University in Omaha, NE. -->

My primary research interests are in **epistemology**. I'm interested in how groups, communities, and institutions influence our judgements about evidence and justification when forming beliefs, attaining knowledge, or pursuing understanding. <!--I have previously published on ...--> I also have secondary interests in general philosophy of science, philosophy of mind/language, and social & political philosophy.
<!-- I focus on belief, rationality, normativity, and responsibility. Specfically, -->

<!-- I'm also passionate about getting undergraduate students involved in philosophy. While at Creighton, I served as the Co-Chair of the [Midwest Undergraduate Philosophy Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/midwest-undergrad-philosophy/home "Midwest Undergraduate Philosophy Conference") Organizing Committee and helped host the most competitive conference in its 25 year history. At Northwestern, I am involved with the Minorities and Philosophy chapter. Resources for all undergraduate students interested in pursuing philosophy are available [here](/more/). -->

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy reading literary fiction, watching TV sitcoms, traveling, trying new food, and completing computer programming challenges on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/tinygenius.png).
