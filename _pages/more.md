I was born in Montana, raised in Idaho and Iowa. Currently, I am enrolled at Creighton University in Nebraska. I study philosophy, economics, and mathematics. My interests are quite diverse, but I love finding areas and issues where each of these areas intersects.

Beyond coursework, I am involved with my campus Philosophy Club, Phi Sigma Tau: International Honor Society in Philosophy, Menard Family Institute for Economic Inquiry, and the [Midwest Undergraduate Philosophy Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/midwest-undergrad-philosophy/home).

Previous research experience
===

Within the past few years, I have been able to assist or work under several professors in their research. In 2023-24, I assisted Professor Anne Ozar on her sabbatical project "Why Trust? Decline in Trust and Dangers to Democracy". This resulted in the presentation of an essay called "Epistemic Unbelonging: Civic Trust in a Post-Truth Democracy" at the 41st International Social Philosophy Conference.

From May 2022 to December 2022, I was a Gail Werner-Robertson Research Fellow with the [Menard Family Center for Economic Inquiry](https://www.creighton.edu/menard-center-for-economic-inquiry) supervised by Professor Michael D. Thomas. My project was titled "Shared Mental Models in the Context of State-Religion" and explored the epistemic impacts of allowing religious governance to occur via national government mechanisms. This resulted in the publication of "Epistemic Vulnerability and Tolerance in Society" in *The Philosophy, Politics, and Economics Review*.

And, finally, during the spring semesters of 2022 and 2023, I participated in Professor Kevin M. Graham's Slave Narrative Research Group. In 2022, the group co-authored an essay "Black Trust and White Allies: Insights from Slave Narratives" which was presented by Prof. Graham at 39th International Social Philosophy Conference and published in *Social Philosophy Today*. In 2023, the group co-authored an essay "Resistance to Oppresion in Slave Narratives" which was presented at 40st International Social Philosophy Conference. -->
