### Course Information

* Instructor: Todd Salzman, PhD, Professor of Theology

### Course Description

RSP 101 introduces freshmen in the College of Arts & Sciences to life at Creighton University. This year long graded course examines the foundations of collegiate life at Creighton, such as Catholic Jesuit traditions and Ignatian pedagogy; the meaning and values of a liberal arts education; and the professional aspirations and academic challenges common to many freshmen. The course introduces student to the CCAS "ratio studiorum" or plan of study, including the College's learning objectives and the degree requirements (major and Core). Students learn about the culture of scholarship, academic integrity, and engaged/experiential learning. Students read and reflect upon texts addressing self-exploration and self-discovery for discussion in class. Faculty Advisors teach the course and invite Decurions (junior or senior peer academic leaders) and Peer Leaders (sophomore leaders) to join them in welcoming freshman students to collegiate life at Creighton.

### Course Objectives
* Students explore the University’s Jesuit Catholic history and understand the key Ignatian values integral to the study of the liberal arts in the College and seek integration of these values at Creighton
* Students are able to articulate the College and University’s learning outcomes as well as policies and resources regarding satisfactory academic progress, support, transient study, and academic integrity and use this information to reflect on their academic work
* Students learn the plan of study required for degree programs (core, major, minor) in the College and apply this understanding to their individual course of study
* Students actively investigate academic programs, experiential learning opportunities (service learning, study abroad, etc.), and extra-curricular activities and incorporate this information in their planning
